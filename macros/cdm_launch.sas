 *  Module:     cdm_launch.sas
 *  Purpose:    Controls the running of the Common Data Model Loader
 *  Version:    2.0
 *  History:
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  This module controls the running of the CDM loader utility and should be updated to
 *  reflect directory locations specific to your environment. It will use history information
 *  maintained by both this utility and the CDM download process to determine the latest data
 *  to load into the database.
 *
 *  Setup:  The Common Data Model (CDM) ETL utility requires the following directory
 *    structure to be created under the "home" directory for the utility.
 *
 *      config    - will contain configuration and temporary files
 *      ddl       - sample definitions for loading the CDM into 3rd party databases
 *      logs      - where the log files from executing the CDM utility will be written
 *      macros    - where the SAS macros comprising the CDM utility will be stored
 *
 *  A SAS macro variable is defined below referencing the top level of this directory
 *  structure.
 *
 *  This utility takes the downloaded CDM SAS data sets and loads them into an on-prem
 *  3rd party database.  This utility does not download the data sets, it requires a
 *  separate process which is provided as a Knowledge Share Application (KSA) and is also
 *  available through GitHub to do the download and creation of the CDM data sets.
 *  A SAS macro variable is defined referencing the location of those previously downloaded
 *  SAS data sets.
 *
 *  DDL files defining the tables and their contents are provided for many databases in
 *  the 'ddl' directory.  This utility has been tested with Oracle and can be used as a
 *  template for loading into other databases with minimal modifications.
